## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I have over 8 years of experience working with IT, 4 of those years working with Software Development and another 4 years with Technical Support.

I am currently working in the engineering department at Indie Campers as a Frontend Engineer and my goal is to increase my seniority level to become a technical leader.

It is part of my routine to develop solutions, review code, test and validate developed resources, using agile methodologies such as scrum.

I am also a graduate student in Information Systems at UFSC and have a technical level in Digital Games Programming at SENAC.

#### ðŸš€ðŸ’» Technologies I have experience with:
