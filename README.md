## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I have over 9 years of experience working in the IT industry, 4 and a half years in Technical Support and the most recent 5 years in Software Development.

I currently work in Fyld's engineering department as a Senior Frontend Developer and my goal is to climb the career ladder and become a Technical Leader.

It is part of my routine to develop solutions, review code, test and validate developed resources, using agile methods such as scrum.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from UFSC and I have a technical level in Digital Game Programming from SENAC.
